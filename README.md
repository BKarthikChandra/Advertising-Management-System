# Advertising-Management-System
This project makes managing outdoor advertising billboards easier and more efficient by simplifying the management of billboard details and information storage. It provides tools for organizing billboard details, managing staff associated with billboard operations, and displaying billboard locations on a map to enhance efficiency. The project aims to streamline the process of handling billboard-related tasks, thereby enhancing the overall organization and productivity of billboard management. My role centered on backend development, using Node.js to craft the server-side logic, with MySQL as the database, ensuring effective functionality of the Outdoor Advertising Management System.
